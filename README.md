## About this project

- The motivation for this project was to create a blog post page to allow users to signup, log in, add posts and to interact with posts. The user has the option of navigating pages but only pages they have log-in priveliges to access, for instance a user can not create a post or comment on a post unless they are logged in.
- The project utilizes an MVC framework to dynamically generate HTML on the page. handlebars, express, and mySQL (sequelize) were primarily used to acccomplish this.
